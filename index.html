        <h2>//BIO:</h2>
          <p>Fifteen of the last nineteen years of my life were spent working in the rock-climbing industry. This pivot into the cybersecurity industry started in early 2019. I am a full-time student that just finished my AAS and am currently ahead of schedule finishing my BS. As of now, my academic goals are to obtain my master's degree and become a teacher focusing on malware analysis and reverse engineering. I am most accessible through my Twitter or Linkedin accounts. This page will expand to something more than it woefully is at the moment, but for now, please enjoy my trash <b><i>HTML</i></b> coding!</p>
